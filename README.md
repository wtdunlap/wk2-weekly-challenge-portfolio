# wk2-weekly-challenge-portfolio

Weekly challenge number 2! 
This is the weekly challenge for week two.
The goal of this project is to build and deploy
a functioning portfolio website. 

## Challenges

Flex and grid were the two biggest obstacles I faced during the production of this website.
I had a hard time decided between an all grid or an all flex or even a hybrid approach.
In the end I went with pure flex. 

##  Requirements

>GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
>
>WHEN I load their portfolio
>
>THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or 
>avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to 
>contact them

>WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
>
>THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

>WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
>
>THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications

>WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
>
>THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others

>WHEN I click on the images of the applications
>
>THEN I am taken to that deployed application

>WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
>
>THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport


I feel as though my project meets or exceeds these requirements.

of all 6 versions of this site, this version is 100% custom. Instructor
feedback and clarification were used throughout the project.
